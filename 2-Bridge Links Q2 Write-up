We will use our previous function (refer to section, give more deets) that allows us to generate 2-bridge link diagrams to test certain properties of 2-bridge links. 

Claim (a): S(p,q) is a knot if p is odd, and has 2 components if p is even.
Solution + Explanation: We find this claim is incorrect by means of a counterexample. This is substantiated by [REFER HERE TO EXACT DIAGRAM]. Here, p is an even number, yet it gives the unknot (i.e. the trivial knot), as opposed to two separate links, as claimed. Further, if p is an odd number, regardless of the parity of p (modq), the output will consistently be the unknot. (HAVE TO GIVE EXAMPLES, SOME SEMBLANCE OF PROOF)

Claim (c): If n $\in\mathbb{Z}$, then S(p,q) = S(p,q+np).
Solution + Explanation: This claim suggests certain periodic behaviour of 2-bridge links. Having tested this claim with numerous examples, it seems to be a true statement. However, this is by no means a rigorous proof. A proof would have to show the topological equivalence of the S(p,q) and S(p,q+np) knot. However, logically approaching this question, we have insight on why this may be true. (EXPLAIN LOGICALLY)

NEW PART 

Claim (a): S(p,q) is a knot if p is odd, and has 2 components if p is even.
Solution + Explanation: We find that this claim is true, and will demonstrate so by providing an exhaustive list of examples. 
1. Assume p is not prime. Let p = 25. Case (i) - S(25,4). Then, p/q is even, and p(modq) is odd and we get the unknot. Case (ii) - S(25,7). Then, p/q is odd, and p(modq) is even, and we get the unknot. Case (iii) - S(25,8). Then, p/q is odd, p(modq) is odd, and we get the unknot.
2. Assume p is prime. Let p = 53. Case (i) - S(53,7). Then, p/q is odd, p(modq) is even, and we get the unknot. Case (ii) - S(53,10). Then, p/q is odd, p(modq) is odd, and we get the unknot. Case (iii) - S(53,5). Then p/q is even, p(modq) is odd, and we get the unknot. This should demonstrate that S(p,q) is a knot if p is odd. Note that we cannot have p/q be even and p(modq) be even as it would require an odd*even number to give us an odd number, which is not possible. 

Now we consider how S(p,q) changes when p is even. 
1. Let p be an even number, say p = 28. Case (i) - S(28,5). Then p/q is odd and p (modq) is odd. Case (ii) - S(28,13). Then p/q is even and *******. CHECK // and SECOND CASE.
All in all, we see that claim (a) is true. 


Claim (b): The link S(p,q) does not depend on the choice of continued fraction, even though the diagram does. 
Solution + Explanation: We find this to be a true statement. We introduce the two lists [1,3,2] and [2,-2,2,-3]. Consider these two continued fraction expansions. {SHOW DIAGRAMS HERE}. Inputting these two lists into our diagram-generating functions, we find that two unique 2-bridge link diagrams are outputted. However, using Euclid's division algorithm, we find that these continued fractions simplify to 9/7. We can verify this by applying the Reidemeister moves [DO WE NEED TO EXPLAIN THIS?] to the two diagrams, which give us the same knot. More abstractly, this claim is suggesting that the topological properties of the S(p,q) link remains consistent. Hence, a rigorous proof would entail showing the resulting knots are topologically equivalent regardless of how p/q is represented. 


Claim (c): If n $\in\mathbb{Z}$, then S(p,q) = S(p,q+np).
Solution + Explanation: We find this to be false statement. Claim (c) only holds for positive integers, such as S(17,12) -> S(17, 29) when n=1, but does not hold for n negative, such as S(17, 12) -/> S(17, -5), where n = 1. 


Claim (d): Changing the sign of all the crossings in S(p,q) gives you S(p,-q) = S(p,p-q).
Solution + Explanation: We find this claim to be incorrect by means of counterexamples (LISTED HERE). We analyse this claim in two parts. First, we will show that S(p,q) = S(p,-q). Then, we will show that S(p,q) ≠ S(p-q), implying that S(p,-q) ≠ S(p,p-q). 

Changing the signs of crossings of S(p,q) will always give us S(p,-q). We will show that when S(p,q) has each element in its continued fraction expansion sign changed, it produces an expansion equivalent to S(p,-q). We use induction. 

[BASE CASE] The smallest continued fraction expansion has length 2. Consider Cont_Frac_Exp1(p,q) = [a,b]. Now, we flip the signs of the elements to get [-a,-b]. When expanded, this gives us -a +1/-b = (ab+1)/-b = p/-q, which gives us the diagram S(p,-q) for the base case.

[INDUCTIVE HYPOTHESIS] Now consider a continued fraction expansion Cont_Frac_Exp1(p,q) of length n, i.e. [a_1,a_2,...,a_n], and assume that when flipping the sign of each element in the expansion, our new expansion is of the form p/-q. 

[INDUCTIVE STEP] We need to show this property holds for Cont_Frac_Exp1(p,q) of length n+1. Let p/-q be the expansion of [-a_1, -a_2, ..., -a_n] with list length n. We add another term, say -a_{n+1} to make the list length n+1 and get [-a_1, -a_2, ..., -a_n, -a_{n+1}], where [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, a_{n+1}] is Cont_Frac_Exp(p,q). Let a_{n+1} = z, and so -a_{n+1} = -z. By our inductive hypothesis, we know that [-a_1, -a_2, ..., -a_n] is of the form p/-q. Adding -a_{n+1}, we get [-a_1, -a_2, ..., -a_n, -a_{n+1}] = -z+1/(p/-q) = -z+(-q/p)  = (-zp-q)/p = -(zp+q)/p = (zp+q)/-p, which is of the form P/-Q. Hence, by Induction, we show that changing the signs of the crossings of S(p,q) fives us S(p,-q), and this holds for all n \in \mathbb{N_{>0}}.

Though this does not imply that S(p,-q) = S(p, p-q).
