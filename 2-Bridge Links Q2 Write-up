We will use our previous function (refer to section, give more deets) that allows us to generate 2-bridge link diagrams to test certain properties of 2-bridge links. 

Claim (a): S(p,q) is a knot if p is odd, and has 2 components if p is even.
Solution + Explanation: We find this claim is incorrect by means of a counterexample. This is substantiated by [REFER HERE TO EXACT DIAGRAM]. Here, p is an even number, yet it gives the unknot (i.e. the trivial knot), as opposed to two separate links, as claimed. Further, if p is an odd number, regardless of the parity of p (modq), the output will consistently be the unknot. (HAVE TO GIVE EXAMPLES, SOME SEMBLANCE OF PROOF)

Claim (b): The link S(p,q) does not depend on the choice of continued fraction, even though the diagram does. 
Solution + Explanation: We find this to be a true statement. We introduce the two lists [1,3,2] and [2,-2,2,-3]. Consider these two continued fraction expansions. {SHOW DIAGRAMS HERE}. Inputting these two lists into our diagram-generating functions, we find that two unique 2-bridge link diagrams are outputted. However, using Euclid's division algorithm, we find that these continued fractions simplify to 9/7. We can verify this by applying the Reidemeister moves to the two diagrams, which give us the same knot. More abstractly, this claim is suggesting that the topological properties of the S(p,q) link remains consistent. Hence, a rigorous proof would entail showing the resulting knots are topologically equivalent regardless of how p/q is represented. 

Claim (c): If n $\in\mathbb{Z}$, then S(p,q) = S(p,q+np).
Solution + Explanation: This claim suggests certain periodic behaviour of 2-bridge links. Having tested this claim with numerous examples, it seems to be a true statement. However, this is by no means a rigorous proof. A proof would have to show the topological equivalence of the S(p,q) and S(p,q+np) knot. However, logically approaching this question, we have insight on why this may be true. (EXPLAIN LOGICALLY)

Claim (d): Changing the sign of all the crossings in S(p,q) gives you S(p,-q) = S(p,p-q).
Solution + Explanation: Again, we find this claim to be incorrect by means of a counterexample. (FIND COUNTEREXAMPLE AND GIVE SOME DESCRIPTION). TO BE COMPLETED.

NEW PART 

Claim (d): Changing the sign of all the crossings in S(p,q) gives you S(p,-q) = S(p,p-q).
Solution + Explanation: We find this claim to be incorrect by means of counterexamples (LISTED HERE). We analyse this claim in two parts. First, we will show that S(p,q) = S(p,-q). Then, we will show that S(p,q) ≠ S(p-q), implying that S(p,-q) ≠ S(p,p-q). 

Changing the signs of crossings of S(p,q) will always give us S(p,-q). We will show that when S(p,q) has each element in its continued fraction expansion sign changed, it produces an expansion equivalent to S(p,-q). We use induction. 

[BASE CASE] The smallest continued fraction expansion has length 2. Consider Cont_Frac_Exp1(p,q) = [a,b]. Now, we flip the signs of the elements to get [-a,-b]. When expanded, this gives us -a +1/-b = (ab+1)/-b = p/-q, which gives us the diagram S(p,-q) for the base case.

[INDUCTIVE HYPOTHESIS] Now consider a continued fraction expansion Cont_Frac_Exp1(p,q) of length n, i.e. [a_1,a_2,...,a_n], and assume that when flipping the sign of each element in the expansion, our new expansion is of the form p/-q. 

[INDUCTIVE STEP] We need to show this property holds for Cont_Frac_Exp1(p,q) of length n+1.
