Investigate the relation between the links S(p,q) and S(p,q') when qq' ≡ 1(mod p).

Rough Answer: We find that the diagrams are vertically flipped and the continued fraction expansion of both (p,q) and (p,q') are (i) flipped and (ii) are always of length three. To see (i) and (ii), let us consider a numerical example. We let p = 23, q = 4, and q' = 6. Then, upon evaluation we get [5,1,3] and [3,1,5] respectively. We can justify this pattern with a range of examples. Thus, let us generalise this process, considering (i) Cont_Frac_Exp1 (p,q)=[a,b,c] and (ii) Cont_Frac_Exp2 (p,q') = [c,b,a]. For (i), we get that p/q = a+1/(b+1/c) = (acb+a+c)/(cb+1), where p = acb+a+c and q = cb+1. For (ii), we get that p/q' = c+1/(b+1/a) = (acb+a+c)/(ab+1), where p = acb+a+c, and q' = ab+1. Performing some basic algebraic manipulation, we find that qq' = (acb^2+ab+cb+1) ≡ b(acb+a+c)+1 (mod (acb+a+c)). Hence, qq' ≡ bp+1 (mod p), i.e. qq' ≡ 1(mod p). So, we have shown algebraically why qq' ≡ 1(mod p). 

We now move on to why Cont_Frac_Exp(p,q) always outputs a list of length three, given qq' ≡ 1(mod p). Consider a continued fraction of length one. This implies q|p, i.e. q = mp for some natural number m, and so qq' (mod p) ≡ 0. Now, consider a continued fraction of length two, say [a,b] and [b,a]*** ADD SOME DETAIL HERE. Then, p/q = a+1/b = (ab+1)/b, and p/q' = b+1/a = (ab+1)/a. So, qq' = ab and p=ab+1, implying that qq' (mod p) = -1 ≠ 1. Now, let us jump to a list of length four. Consider (p,q) = [a,b,c,d] and (p,q') = [d,c,b,a]. Then, p/q = a+1/(b+1/(c+1/d)) = a+(cd+1/bcd+b+d) = (abcd+ba+bd+cd+1)/(bcd+b+d) = (a(bcd+b+d)+cd+1)/(bcd+b+d). Here, p = a(bcd+b+d)+cd+1 and q = bcd+b+d. Using the same logic for p/q' to find q', we can swap a and d, b and c, to get q' = cba+b+a. Thus, qq' = (bcd+b+d)(cba+c+a) = (HAVE TO CONFIRM), which naturally does not factor to 1. Now, for a length five or more, since the factorisation of [a,b,c,d,e,...] depends on the factorisation of length four, we arrive at the conclusion that it will not satisfy qq' ≡ 1(mod p). Hence, we have shown that qq' ≡ 1(mod p) is only possible when len(NEED TO FILL IN) = len(NEED TO FILL IN) = three.
