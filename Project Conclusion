While relatively unknown, the study of knots is widely applicable in the natural sciences, including the study of DNA strands and molecular structures. Further, in the late 19th Century, it was believed that knots make up the structure of the atom, developed by William Thomson, coined the Vortex theory of the atom (REFERENCE). Through this project, we hope to have motivated the study of knots, and demonstrated how we can use robust programming techniques and recursive relations to characterise/differentiate unique knots and 2-bridge links.
