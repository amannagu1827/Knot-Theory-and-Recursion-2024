Through this project, we hope to have provided some intuiton on knot theory, and shown how we can use recursive relations to characterise describe knots and links. While relatively unknown, the study of knots have a wide applicability, including the study of DNA strands and molecular structures. Further, in the late 19th Century, it was believed that knots make up the structure of the atom, developed by William Thomson, coined the Vortex theory of the atom. 

STILL WORKING ON THIS.
