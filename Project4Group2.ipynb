    "Knots have played an indelible role in the evolution of human civilisations, serving as fundamental tools for binding objects to each other. It was only in the mid 19th century when knots were studied mathematically. In 1833, Carl Friedrich Gauss pioneered the advancement of Knot Theory by analysing various knots and links using techniques developed in differential geometry (See [3]). Gauss prefigured the idea that knots can be share the same behavioural tendencies as geometric objects. This motivates the utility of certain programming techniques, particularly recursion and recursive relations, that can be employed to further manipulate these objects. Such algorithms can be developed to efficiently study arbitrarily intricate knot structures, identifying patterns and allowing us to test hypotheses on properties of abstract knots. As a result, developments in Knot Theory in the past 50 years is directly correlated the increased usage of programming in mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by building intuition on recursive relations through the exploration of continuted fractions. In Section 1.1, we establish two unique functions that calculate a continued fraction for a given $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$, $q$ are coprime. In doing so, we motivate the use of Euclid's Algorithm. Next, in Section 1.2, we develop an efficient function that will recalculate and output a rational number given an arbitrary list. These introductory exercises will provide the reader with a foundation on working with fractions and recursions computationally. As we progress, we shall delve deeper into the subtle relationship between recursion and knots - in particular, how we use recursive relations to define, examine, and test properties of knots. "

    "Having established the fundamentals, in the next chapter, we shall explore knot theory more abstractly, testing our hypotheses using the computational tools we have previously developed. We first introduce 2-bridge links - an object with several loops containing two local maxima - and design a function to output a 2-bridge link diagram for a given rational number p/q with certain conditions. We make use of the fact that, for every rational number $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are coprime, there exists an associated 2-bridge link $S(p,q)$. Having constructed and optimised this algorithm, we proceed to run tests to deduce properties about 2-bridge links. This includes experiments on manipulating the parity of $p$ and $q$, and testing potential periodicity of $S(p,q)$. We then summarise by investigating the relationship between $S(p,q)$ and $S(p,q’)$, where $p$ is fixed and $qq’$ satisfies a given modular relation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude this project by introducing knot invariants, particularly 2-bridge link invariants. We analyse d-invariants of $S(p,q)$, i.e. a collection of $p$ rational numbers denoted $d(S(p,q),i)$. We do so by establishing a homomorphism between our $S(p,q)$ knot group and an arbitrary 3-dimensional manifold, say $L(p,q)$, and then take the 'd'-invariant of this manifold. First, we will write a function to calculate $d(S(p,q),i)$, and list the outputted rational numbers. Then, we study the effect of the d-invariant in the special case that $S(p,q_1) = S(p,q_2)$ for arbitrary coprime $p, q_1, q_2$. We conclude by examining some more theory on d-invariants using our code. "

Now, let $-q = r$. Then $S(p,-q) = S(p,r)$. Note that $S(p, p + r)$ is of the form $S(p, np + r)$ when $n = 1$. As per (c), $S(p,r) \\neq S(p, np + r)$ for $n \\neq = 0$, and here, $n = 1$.

To see (i) and (ii), let us consider a numerical example. We let $p = 23$, $q = 4$, and $q' = 6$. Then, upon evaluation we get `[5, 1, 3]` and `[3, 1, 5]` respectively. We can justify this pattern with a range of examples. Thus, let us generalise this process, considering (i) `cont_frac_exp1(p,q) =[a,b,c]` and (ii) `cont_frac_exp1(p,q') = [c, b, a]`. For (i), we get that $\\frac{p}{q} = a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{c}} = \\frac{acb + a + c}{cb +1 }$, where $p = acb + a + c$ and $q = cb + 1$. For (ii), we get that $\\frac{p}{q'} = c + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{a}} = \\frac{acb + a + c}{ab + 1}$, where $p = acb + a + c$, and $q' = ab + 1$. Performing some basic algebraic manipulation, we find that $qq' = (acb^{2} + ab + cb + 1) \\equiv b(acb+a+c) + 1 \\bmod{acb + a + c}$. Hence, $qq' \\equiv bp + 1\\bmod{p}$, i.e. $qq' \\equiv 1\\bmod{p}$. So, we have shown algebraically why $qq' \\equiv 1\\bmod{p}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We now move on to why `cont_frac_exp1(p,q)` always outputs a list of length 3, given $qq' \\equiv 1\\bmod{p}$. We have already provided an example on how `cont_frac_exp1(p,q)` does output a list of length 3, but we will show that any list it outputs will be of length 3, with the condition that $qq' \\equiv 1\\bmod{p}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a continued fraction of length 1. This implies $q \\vert p$, i.e. $q = mp$ for some integer $m$, and so $qq' \\bmod{p} \\equiv 0$. Now, consider a continued fraction of length 2, say `cont_frac_exp1[a,b]` and `cont_frac_exp1[b,a]`. Then, $\\frac{p}{q} = a+\\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{ab+1}{b}$, and $\\frac{p}{q'} = b + \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{ab+1}{a}$. So, $qq' = ab$ and $p = ab +1 $, implying that $qq' \\bmod{p} = -1 \\neq 1$. Now, let us jump to a list of length 4. Consider $(p,q) = $`[a, b, c, d]` and $(p,q') = $`[d, c, b, a]`. Then, $\\frac{p}{q} = a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{c + \\frac{1}{d}}} = a + (cd + \\frac{1}{bcd+b+d}) = \\frac{abcd + ba + bd + cd + 1}{bcd + b + d} = \\frac{a(bcd + b + d) + cd +1}{bcd + b + d}$. Here, $p = a(bcd + b +d ) + cd + 1$ and $q = bcd + b + d$, and thus $q \\bmod{p} \\equiv cd + 1$. Using the same logic for $\\frac{p}{q'}$ to find $q'$, we can swap $a$ and $d, b$ and $c$, to get $q' = cba + b + a$. Thus, $qq' = (bcd + b + d)(cba + c + a)$, which naturally does not factor to 1. Now, for a length 5 or more, since the factorisation of `[a, b, c, d, e, ...]` depends on the factorisation of length 4, we arrive at the conclusion that it will not satisfy $qq' \\equiv 1\\bmod{p}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we have shown that $qq' \\equiv 1\\bmod{p}$) is only possible when `len(cont_frac_exp1(p,q)) = len(cont_frac_exp1(p,q')) = 3`. Further, we have shown that the continued fraction expansions are always flipped, and so the diagrams $S(p,q)$ and $S(p,q')$ preserve the same structure as they are knots and crossings. Though, note that the diagrams are vertically flipped. \n"

    "We now move on to the final topic of this project. We introduce the d-invariant of $S(p,q)$. Recall that this is an arbitrary collection of $p$ rational numbers assigned to a 2-bridge link $S(p,q)$, denoted by $d(S(p,q), i)$, where $p,q$ are coprime. As mentioned previously, we use the 2-bridge link $S(p,q)$ to determine a 3-dimensional manifold $L(p,q)$. While beyond the scope of this project, we do so by constructing a homomorphism between our link and $L(p,q)$. The existence of this homomorphism is proven by Kronheimer and Mrowka in 2010 (See [1]). Then '$d$' is the invariant of this manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural question may arise. What exactly do we mean by the 'invariant' of a manifold? This refers to a property associated with the manifold $L(p,q)$ which remains unchanged under certain transformations. We find that the $d$-invariant displays certain characteristics and behaviours. For all $p>0$, $d(S(p,q), i)$ satisfies some recursive relations. First, for $p=1$, and any $q,i$, we define $d(S(1,q),i) = 0$. Next, letting $a\\%p$ denote the integer between 0 and $p$ that is congruent to $a$ (mod $p$), we find that $d(S(p,q), i)$ = $d(S(p,q\\%p),i\\%p)$. Last, for $p>q>0$ and $0≤i<p+q$, we have $d(S(p,q),i)$ = $\\frac{(2i+1-p-q)^2-pq}{4pq} - d(S(p,q),i)$. (See [4])\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these relations, we now look to write a function to calculate $d(S(p,q), i)$. Subsequently, we will develop code that will allow us to compute the list of $d$-invariants for any 2-bridge link $S(p,q)$. We move on to analysing two topologically equivalent links $S(p,q_1)$ and $S(p,q_2)$. We explore how this topological equivalence impacts the $d$-invariant. This leads us to our final question - when $S(p,q_1)$ and $S(p,q_2)$ are different links, does that guarantee a different $d$-invariant? We thoroughly investigate these claims by running tests using our functions and providing ample examples to support our arguments.\n",

    "While relatively unknown, the study of knots is widely applicable in the natural sciences, including the study of DNA strands and molecular structures. Further, in the late 19th Century, it was believed that knots make up the structure of the atom, developed by William Thomson, coined the Vortex theory of the atom (See [2]). Through this project, we hope to have motivated the study of knots, and demonstrated how we can use robust programming techniques and recursive relations to characterise/differentiate unique knots and 2-bridge links.
