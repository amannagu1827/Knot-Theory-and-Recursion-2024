    "Recursion is one of the most powerful tools in programming. It is not only a rather intuitive mathematical concept, but it is also easy to implement in any programming language. In this Python project, we shall both visually and mathematically appreciate the power of recursion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We shall focus on a set of modules collectively known as `PyGame` (see [(Shinners, 2021)](#PyGame_Intro)), as they provide a concise way for us to produce interactive animations within Python. The language of recursion naturally leads to the study of *fractals*, _id est_ self-repeating patterns and geometric objects. As we shall see later, a lot of patterns in nature are also closely related to fractals. "

    "The first chapter of the project consists of three short parts, aiming to understand the power of the `PyGame` module. Firstly, in section 1.1, we shall introduce and develop a simple PyGame animation function bouncing_ball, in which one or more balls bounce in a square box in two dimensions with various constraints. In section 1.2, we shall introduce fractals through the Sierpinski triangle and make an animation of how the Sierpinski triangles are produced. In section 1.3, we shall explore a particular construction and animation of a recursively defined “tree”. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second chapter of the project shall focus on some interesting applications when we shall integrate PyGame with different programming techniques. In section 2.1, we shall look at Julia sequences and we shall animate the Julia set as a transition from one picture to another. In addition to this, we shall look at Mandelbrot sequences, and then we shall create a program that zooms in and out of the Mandelbrot set. Finally, in section 2.2, we shall explore a classical puzzle - the Towers of Hanoi. We shall briefly look at the solution, the animation, and other space and time complexity issues."

    "\n",
    "- In the classical variant, there must be one move where disk $n$ is moved from peg $A$ to $C$, before and after that, the move can be copied from the optimal moves in the solution of $n-1$ disks to solve the puzzle. That explains the $T(n-1)$ term in the recurrence relation.\n",

    "- Similarly, in the no wrap variant, there must be two move that move disk $n$ from peg $A$ to $B$, then peg $B$ to $C$, that leaves three 'gaps' in between the two moves. That's why there are three $T(n-1)$ term present.\n",

    "So in conclusion, the code for `ToH_Move_Left` and `ToH_NoWrap_Move_Left` is fully optimized in terms of solution length. However, we note that there exists numerous iterative solution that involve searching a valid move under a configuration (see the 'Solution' tab in [(Wikipedia Contributors, 2022)](#Wiki)). In our project, this may mean searching in a loop inside the function `ToH_Valid_Move`, which, to the authors, is an unncessary complication which may cause further runtime loss.\n",
