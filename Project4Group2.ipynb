    "Knots have played an indelible role in the evolution of human civilisations, serving as fundamental tools for binding objects to each other. It was only in the mid 19th Century when knots were studied mathematically. In 1833, Carl Friedrich Gauss pioneered the advancement of Knot Theory by analysing various knots/links using techniques developed in differential geometry. Gauss subconsciously hinted the idea that knots can be treated as geometric objects. (FILLER) Recursion/recursive relations are robust programming techniques that can be employed to study/manipulate these objects. Such algorithms can be developed to efficiently study arbitrary knot structures, identifying patterns and allowing us to test hypotheses on the properties of abstract knots. This allows mathematicians to study knot theory from a rather algorithmic lens. \n",

    "In Chapter 1, we seek to build intuition on recursion through the exploration of continued fractions. Firstly, in Section 1.1, we will establish two functions that will calculate a continued fraction for a given p/q, where p,q are coprime. This will motivate the exploration and use of Euclid’s Algorithm. Note that these functions will generate unique expansions. Second, in Section 1.2, we will develop an efficient function that will recalculate a rational number given an arbitrary list. These exercises will provide the reader with basic intuition regarding recursion more computationally. As we progress, we shall delve deeper into the subtle relationship between recursion and knots, i.e. how we can use recursive relations to define and examine properties of knots. "

    "In Chapter 2, we shall explore knot theory in greater depth, using the computational tools we have previously developed. We will first explore the fundamentals of 2-bridge knots, studying the claim that, for every rational number p/q, where p,q are coprime, there is an associated 2-bridge knot S(p,q). We analyse this statement by developing an algorithm for S(p,q), given p,q. After constructing this algorithm, (in section blah blah) we will run certain tests to deduce properties about 2-bridge knots, including manipulating the parity and sign of p and q. We conclude this section by investigating the relationship between S(p,q) and S(p,q’), where p is fixed and qq’ satisfies a particular modular relation.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- In the classical variant, there must be one move where disk $n$ is moved from peg $A$ to $C$, before and after that, the move can be copied from the optimal moves in the solution of $n-1$ disks to solve the puzzle. That explains the $T(n-1)$ term in the recurrence relation.\n",

    "- Similarly, in the no wrap variant, there must be two move that move disk $n$ from peg $A$ to $B$, then peg $B$ to $C$, that leaves three 'gaps' in between the two moves. That's why there are three $T(n-1)$ term present.\n",

    "So in conclusion, the code for `ToH_Move_Left` and `ToH_NoWrap_Move_Left` is fully optimized in terms of solution length. However, we note that there exists numerous iterative solution that involve searching a valid move under a configuration (see the 'Solution' tab in [(Wikipedia Contributors, 2022)](#Wiki)). In our project, this may mean searching in a loop inside the function `ToH_Valid_Move`, which, to the authors, is an unncessary complication which may cause further runtime loss.\n",
