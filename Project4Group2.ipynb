    "Knots have played an indelible role in the evolution of human civilsations, serving as fundamental tools for binding objects to each other. It was only in the mid 19th Century when knots were studied mathematically. In 1833, Carl Friedrich Gauss pionerred the advancement of Knot Theory by analysing various knots and links using techniques developed in differential geometry. Gauss subconciously hinted the idea that knots can be share the same behavioural tendencies as geometric objects. This motivates the utility of certain programming techniques, particularly recursion and recursive relations, that can be employed to further manipulate these objects. Such algorithms can be developed to efficiently study arbitrarily intricate knot structures, identifying patterns and allowing us to test hypotheses on properties of abstract knots. As a result, developments in Knot Theory in the past 50 years is directly correlated the increased usage of programming in mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by building intuition on recursive relations through the exploration of continuted fractions. In Section 1.1, we establish two unique functions that calculate a continuted fraction for a given p/q, where p,q are coprime. In doing so, we motivate the use of Euclid's Algorithm. Next, in Section 1.2, we develop an efficient function that will recalculate and output a rational number given an arbitrary list. These introductory exereices will provide the reader with a foundation on working with fractions and recursions computationally. As we progress, we shall delve deeper into the subtle relationship between recursion and knots - in particular, how we use recursive relations to define, examine, and test properties of knots. "

    "Having established the fundamentals, in the next chapter, we shall explore knot theory more abstractly, testing our hypotheses using the computational tools we have previously developed. We first introduce 2-bridge links - an object with several loops containing two local maxima - and design a function to output a 2-bridge link diagram for a given rational number p/q with certain conditions. We make use of the fact that, for every rational number p/q, where p,q are coprime, there exists an associated 2-bridge link S(p,q). Having constructed and optimised this algorithm, we proceed to run tests to deduce properties about 2-bridge links. This includes experiments on manipulating the parity of p and q, and testing potential periodicity of S(p,q). We then summarise by investigating the relationship between S(p,q) and S(p,q’), where p is fixed and qq’ satisfies a given modular relation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude this project by introducing knot invariants, particularly 2-bridge link invariants. We analyse d-invariants of S(p,q), i.e. a collection of p rational numbers denoted d(S(p,q),i). We do so by establishing a homomorphism between our S(p,q) knot group and an arbitrary 3-dimensional manifold, say L(p,q), and then take the 'd'-invariant of this manifold. First, we will write a function to calculate d(S(p,q),i), and list the outputted rational numbers. Then, we study the effect of the d-invariant in the special case that S(p,q_1) = S(p,q_2) for arbitrary coprime p,q_1,q_2. We conclude by examining some more theory on d-invariants using our code. "

    "Now as promised in the previous parts, we look at different time and space complexity issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, recall that we discussed the classical amnd no wrap variant have optimal length of solution $2^n-1$ and $3^n-1$ respectively. The informal reason of why they are optimal is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the classical variant, there must be one move where disk $n$ is moved from peg $A$ to $C$, before and after that, the move can be copied from the optimal moves in the solution of $n-1$ disks to solve the puzzle. That explains the $T(n-1)$ term in the recurrence relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly, in the no wrap variant, there must be two move that move disk $n$ from peg $A$ to $B$, then peg $B$ to $C$, that leaves three 'gaps' in between the two moves. That's why there are three $T(n-1)$ term present.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in conclusion, the code for `ToH_Move_Left` and `ToH_NoWrap_Move_Left` is fully optimized in terms of solution length. However, we note that there exists numerous iterative solution that involve searching a valid move under a configuration (see the 'Solution' tab in [(Wikipedia Contributors, 2022)](#Wiki)). In our project, this may mean searching in a loop inside the function `ToH_Valid_Move`, which, to the authors, is an unncessary complication which may cause further runtime loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, We shall look at how memoization speeds up the function call for large values of $n$ to show the importance of this technique.  We first start by implementing the no memoization version of functions that produces a solution, with a suffix `_NoMem` after their usual names in order to distinguish them.\n"
