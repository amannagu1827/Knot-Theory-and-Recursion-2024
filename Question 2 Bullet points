2a) 
#Part A is False as

diagram(2,2) 

#P is even , yet it gives the unknot, rather than two seperate links.

# if pmodq is odd, we get it gives us the unknot, but when even it gives us a two links. 

# If p is odd, regardless of pmodq being even or odd, it will always give us the unknot.

*Give examples of the above cases*

2b) True 
[1, 3, 2] and [2, −2, 2, −3] Consider these two continues fraction expansions, they will give us two different diagrams when printed but using Euclids Algorithm, we get they both give us the same fraction 9/7.
We can verify this using ridermister moves on the two draigrams to give us the same knot

2c) True

Not sure how to come up with an explaination as it involves some theory, but after checking it with countless examples, they always match up
