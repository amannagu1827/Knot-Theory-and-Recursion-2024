We look to briefly introduce Reidemeister moves. These are 3 types of topological deformations that can be applied to knots to determine whether knots are equivalent. This was developed by German mathematician Kurt Reidemeister in 1927. 
Reidemeister Moves (See [5], [6]):
(i) Twisting/untwisting a string in either direction. 
(ii) Move a string over another string. 
(iii) Move a strand from one side of a crossing to another. 

(Simplified) Reidemeister Theorem: Two knots are equivalent iff they result from each other by a finite number of Reidemeister moves.
