We now move on to the final topic of this project. We introduce the d-invariant of S(p,q). Recall that this is an arbitrary collection of p rational numbers assigned to a 2-bridge link S(p,q), denoted by d(S(p,q), i), where p,q are coprime. As mentioned previously, we use the 2-bridge link S(p,q) to determine a 3-dimensional manifold L(p,q). While beyond the scope of this project, we do so by constructing a homomorphism between our link and L(p,q). The existence of this homomorphism is proven by Kronheimer and Mrowka [2010]. (PUT REFERENCE) Then 'd' is the invariant of this manifold. 

A natural question may arise. What exactly do we mean by the 'invariant' of a manifold? This refers to a property associated with the manifold L(p,q) which remains unchanged under certain transformations. We find that the d-invariant displays certain characteristics and behaviours. For all p>0, d(S(p,q), i) satisfies some recursive relations. First, for p=1, and any q,i, we define d(S(1,q),i) = 0. Next, letting a%p denote the integer between 0 and p that is congruent to a (modp), we find that d(S(p,q), i) = d(S(p,q%p),i%p). Last, for p>q>0 and 0â‰¤i<p+q, we have d(S(p,q),i) = $\frac{(2i+1-p-q)^2-pq}{4pq}$ - d(S(p,q),i). 

Given these relations, we now look to write a function to calculate d(S(p,q), i). Subsequently, we will develop code that will allow us to compute the list of d-invariants for any 2-bridge link S(p,q). We move on to analysing two topologically equivalent links S(p,q_1) and S(p,q_2). We explore how this topological equivalence impacts the d-invariant. This leads us to our final question - when S(p,q_1) and S(p,q_2) are different links, does that guarantee a different d-invariant? We thoroughly investigate these claims by running tests using our functions and providing ample examples to support our arguments.
