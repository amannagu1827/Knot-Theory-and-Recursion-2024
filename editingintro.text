Knots have played an indelible role in the evolution of human civilisations, serving as fundamental tools for binding objects to each other. It was only in the mid 19th Century when knots were studied mathematically. In 1833, Carl Friedrich Gauss pioneered the advancement of Knot Theory by analysing various knots/links using techniques developed in differential geometry. Gauss subconsciously hinted the idea that knots can be treated as geometric objects. (FILLER) Recursion/recursive relations are robust programming techniques that can be employed to study/manipulate these objects. Such algorithms can be developed to efficiently study arbitrary knot structures, identifying patterns and allowing us to test hypotheses on the properties of abstract knots. This allows mathematicians to study knot theory from a rather algorithmic lens.

In Chapter 1, we seek to build intuition on recursion through the exploration of continued fractions. Firstly, in Section 1.1, we will establish two functions that will calculate a continued fraction for a given p/q, where p,q are coprime. This will motivate the exploration and use of Euclid’s Algorithm. Note that these functions will generate unique expansions. Second, in Section 1.2, we will develop an efficient function that will recalculate a rational number given an arbitrary list. These exercises will provide the reader with basic intuition regarding recursion more computationally. As we progress, we shall delve deeper into the subtle relationship between recursion and knots, i.e. how we can use recursive relations to define and examine properties of knots.

In Chapter 2, we shall explore knot theory in greater depth, using the computational tools we have previously developed. We will first explore the fundamentals of 2-bridge knots, studying the claim that, for every rational number p/q, where p,q are coprime, there is an associated 2-bridge knot S(p,q). We analyse this statement by developing an algorithm for S(p,q), given p,q. After constructing this algorithm, (in section blah blah) we will run certain tests to deduce properties about 2-bridge knots, including manipulating the parity and sign of p and q. We conclude this section by investigating the relationship between S(p,q) and S(p,q’), where p is fixed and qq’ satisfies a particular modular relation.

We conclude this project by introducing the notion of invariance, in particular, the d-invariant of S(p,q), a collection of p rational number.s (TO BE FINISHED AND MODIFIED AND ADDED TO)
